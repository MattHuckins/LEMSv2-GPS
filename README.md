# LEMSv2-GPS
LEMSv2 GPS w/standalone option

## Intro

The LEMSv2 is an open source environmental monitoring station, which was designed to be deployed for extended periods of time and powered by a 5W solar panel (More information can be found on Madvoid's LEMSv2 GitHub page).

## Objective
The objective of this project is to incorperate a GPS module into the existing LEMSv2 system, while considering the low energy consumption goals of the original LEMSv2 environmental monitoring system. The two main goals of the this project are: to use the GPS module to update the RTC if the system malfunctions in a manner that resets the RTC, to datalog multiple location data to an SD card for the purpose of secondary statistical analysis.

## Library additions to the original LEMSv2

#include "variant.h"            // Multiplexing library for SAMD boards

<TinyGPS++.h>          // TimyGPS++ a GPS library

#include <RTClibExtended.h>             // RTC Library - https://github.com/adafruit/RTClib

// added '#define _BV(bit) (1 << (bit))' to RTClibExtended.h

  - This one line of code must be added to the RTClibExtended.h file to fix a known issue with a bit shift.

## Known issues

  - If you attempt to set the time in a completely indoor location, void of windows, the time will be set to 01/01/2000.

  - It was randomly observed that the SD card failed initialize and properly store the data in 1 of the 30 trail runs prior to the write up. Research on forums indicates that the default SD library has been observed to behave unusually.

  -The SD.begin must be called twice or the initialization fails, which leads me to believe that either the SD library has a conflict, or the RX pin that was remapped from the A2 pin printed on the microcontroller may be used by the computer for an unknown process. However, the version included is stable
  
## Items to be selected

  - Controllable voltage regulator to be controlled by digital pin 4 for the powering on and off of the GPS module.
  
  - how many location points are desired by the user (adjust the for loop size and the size of the lists being stored in the defined function on lines : 179, 356, 370 )


## Future recommnendations

  - remove or increase the timeout duration in the defined GPS location function in the code, in the event that system is deployed in heavily forested area, or in location with robust obstructions, to grant or deny the system additional time to perform functions

  - NEO GPS: a more efficient and powerful GPS library, instead of tinyGPS++

  - To account for differing satelite locations and satelite 'drift' that will possibly be observed in the recorded location data at different times throughout the day, record GPS location multiple times throughout the day

  - For additional power saving purposes to the general (and original) LEMSv2 datalogging feature, it may be beneficial to utilize the RAM on the SAMD 21 board. This could be done by logging weather data blocks in RAM, allowed by the total availible RAM, and then sending the blocks of data to the SD card instead of logging one row of data at a time to the SD card.
